        <h1> Prized Vintage Shoe Collection For Sale!</h1>

        <p> Did you fall in love with vintage shoes just like me after watching <cite>Sex and the City</cite>? Vintage Prada, Dior, and Manolo - all heels worthy of a strut down Manhattan!
            This collection of shoes are much more than just another addition to your wardrobe - each pair of heels tells a story. Timeless and handcrafted shoes that should be celebrated and held dear.
            It <em>pains</em> me to have to list them. But hey, paying for tuition to build a career <em>opens</em> the doors to <em>more</em> shoes!
        </p>

        <p>All <strong>rare</strong> finds and in <strong>great conditon!</strong> These shoes were not easy to find - I looked high and low on Ebay, depop, old vintage shops, anywhere and everywhere to build my collection.
            After watching <cite>Sex and the City</cite>, my love for shoes grew. I wanted to be just like Carrie and have whatever Manolo Blahnik shoe I could get my hands on.
            Some may call me <strong>crazy</strong>- spending time, effort, and <strong>money</strong> to get vintage designer shoes. But it's not about the brand name - <em>it's about the history that these shoes carry.</em>
            They reflect different times of style, class, and culture. Having these shoes in my hands, I was able to add a chapter to their book of life.
            <em>These shoes are carefully curated treasures meant to be loved and worn again, passed down from woman to woman.</em></p>
